# Docker Mastery

## Creating a Three Node Swarm Cluster

1. [play-with-docker.com](https://play-with-docker.com)
    - Only needs a browser, but resets after 4 hours
2. docker-machine + VirtualBox
    - Free and runs locally, but requires a machine with 8GB memory
3. Digital Ocean + Docker install
    - Most like a production setup, but costs
      **$5-10/node/month** while learning
4. D.Roll your own
    - `docker-machine` can provision machines for Amazon,
      Azure, DO, Google, etc.
    - Install docker anywhere with [get.docker.com](https://get.docker.com)
